# Mail and Deliveries

## **Use of Mailboxes**

Mailboxes for all Units are situated in the Lobby.  Each Homeowner is responsible to provide such key to its Lessees and is responsible for any costs of replacing the key. 

The Association does not have a master or spare key to individual Unit mailboxes.

## **Procedures for Package**

### **Packages**

Size limitations for items which will be accepted at the front desk of the Association are the same as the United States Post Office which are as follows:  up to 108” combined measurements of length and girth of packages and up to **70 pounds in weight**, excluding such specifications. Residents are obligated to make special arrangements for deliveries of any large packages or furniture or appliances, excluding such specifications. Deliveries received on pallets will not be accepted. The package must be removed from the pallet\(s\) before being delivered to AXIS. Residents will be obligated to execute the Policy for Acceptance of Packages and Envelopes set forth in the Forms section of this Handbook as a condition to acceptance of the packages at the front desk.

### **Large Quantities**

Residents shall not use the mailroom to receive large quantities of merchandise for commercial reasons.  

### **Signatures**

Parcels or packages sent via delivery methods that require signature will be accepted so long as the Resident has authorized the General Manager or the Front Desk to sign for such parcel or package by completing the Policy for Acceptance of Packages/Envelopes.  No bailment is created as a result of the acceptance of such packages by the attendant for the Association.

### **Certified Mail**

Certified mail and mail sent “Cash on Delivery” to a Resident will not be accepted by the General Manager or other attendant.

### **Failure to Pick Up Packages**

Packages not picked up within **seven \(7\) days** of delivery will be sent back to sender unless the Resident to whom it is addressed has provided written authorization for packages to be held or deposited into his/her Unit.  

## **No Liability for Conditions**

The Association assumes no responsibility for the condition of any package and reserves the right to discontinue accepting deliveries for any Resident abusing this service.
