## **Emergency Procedures**

Each elevator in the Building is programmed to return to the ground floor during an Emergency, malfunction or power failure.  In such event, each elevator will automatically cancel its current destination and immediately redirect itself back to the ground floor to allow all passengers to exit.  

### **Limitations**

**DO NOT** enter any elevator during an emergency.  In case of fire / smoke at or near an elevator waiting lobby, the elevators are programmed to bring themselves down to the ground floor and open their doors only once during an emergency and will not function normally until being reset by the appropriate Building personnel.  Additionally, the backup generators that power the elevators during an emergency may be depleted at any time and may not have enough power to bring an elevator down to the ground floor from its current location.  

### **Phones**

If an elevator fails to perform as described above, there is an emergency phone installed in every elevator, which may be accessed by pressing the phone button.  The emergency phone is wired to automatically dial directly to the elevator service provider when the button is pressed.
