# Balconies and Patios

AXIS balconies and patios are Exclusive Use Common Areas. Alterations and landscaping may not be made to Exclusive Use Common Areas without architectural approval. 

Homeowners must request approval prior to making alterations or installing landscaping by submitting their proposed alteration plan via an Architectural Request form to the General Manager. The Homeowner should produce a clearly defined plan that shows placement and types of improvements. Photographs of proposed landscaping and dimensions are highly encouraged to expedite review.

* Requests will be handled in a timely manner \(not to exceed 30 days from submittal to the General Manager\).
* To allow time for review, requests should be submitted at least two weeks prior to the next board meeting.
* Those Homeowners who have already landscaped their balcony or patio, and have not received prior approval, should document with photos and submit them to the General Manager. 

The review and approval by the HOA Board for furnishings and other additions to Exclusive Use Common Areas serves several purposes:

* It ensures that additions are suitable in spaces that are prone to high winds and are lined with glass-panel railings.
* It supports the attractiveness of the building since, in many cases, patios and balconies are visible from the street and by other Residents. 
* It maintains a complementary aesthetic in order to preserve property value.
* It minimizes the potential for a Homeowner to purchase furnishings or additions that may not be permitted by the community by-laws \(i.e. barbecues, fire pits, propane heaters, umbrellas, furniture with colors that are not complimentary aesthetic, etc.\). 
* Landscaping improvements should leave no permanent avoidable marks on balcony or patio pavement and glass railings. Unavoidable stains from plant watering are exempted.

The review process does not seek to limit freedom of expression or personal taste, but strives to support the installation of furnishings or additions that convey the quality and visual character of the AXIS property. 

The Board seeks to approve plans that meet the following objectives: 

* Furniture designed for outdoor and year-round use, rust resistant and color-fast
* Furnishings should be complementary to the AXIS architecture
* Plants and pots are to be of an appropriate size, style, and color to coincide with the look of the building.

Storage boxes and units may not be included as part of a landscape plan if they occupy more than 10% of a patio or balcony. 

The following items are not permitted in the Exclusive Use Common Areas and will not be approved by the Board. 

* Propane appliances 
* Satellite dishes 
* BBQâ€™s of all types 
* Items attached to the railings 
* Decorative flags, wind chimes, signs or other such decorative items \(excluding the flag of the United States of America/other Nations\)
* Flooring systems that impact drainage 
* In most instances, outdoor area rugs unless they can be secured by substantial furniture or plantings to hold them in place.

The review process does not seek to limit freedom of expression or personal taste, but strives to support the installation of furnishings or additions that convey the quality and visual character of the AXIS property. 

All Exclusive Use Common Areas are subject to routine review for compliance.
