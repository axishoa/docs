If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting, a majority of the Members entitled to vote thereat may, unless otherwise provided by law, adjourn the meeting to a date not less than five \(5\) days and not more than thirty \(30\) days from the meeting date, at which meeting the quorum requirements shall be one-third \(1/3\) of the total voting power \(excluding the number of votes as to which voting rights are suspended at the time of the subject meeting\).

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of obtaining membership approval of Special Assessments or increases in Regular Assessments as may be required by Section 4.3 of the Declaration, a "quorum" means more than fifty percent \(50%\) of the Members of the Association.

### 3.5. Proxies

At all meetings of Members, each Member may vote in person or by proxy. All proxies shall be in writing and filed with the Secretary before the appointed time of each meeting.

Every proxy shall be revocable and shall automatically cease upon conveyance by the Member of his Unit, or upon receipt of written notice by the Secretary of the Board of the death or judicially declared incompetence of a Member prior to the counting of the vote, or upon the expiration of eleven \(11\) months from the date of the proxy. Any form of proxy distributed by any person to the membership of the Association shall afford the opportunity to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of matters to be acted upon. The proxy shall provide that, where the Member specifies a choice, the vote shall be cast in accordance with that choice. The proxy also shall identify the person or persons authorized to exercise the proxy and the length of time it will be valid. In addition, voting by proxy shall comply with any other applicable requirements of California Corporations Code §§ 7514 and 7613.

### 3.6. Membership and Voting

The Association shall have two \(2\) classes of voting membership:

**Class A:** Class A Members shall be all Owners with the exception of the Declarant \(as defined in the Declaration\) and shall be entitled to one \(1\) vote for each Unit owned. When more than one \(1\) person holds an interest in any Unit, all such persons shall be Members. The vote for such Unit shall be exercised as they among themselves determine, but in no event shall more than one \(1\) vote be cast with respect to any Unit.

**Class B:** The Class B Member shall be the Declarant, whose voting rights shall be the same as for Class A memberships, except that the Class B Member may triple its votes for each Unit owned. The Class B membership shall cease and be converted to Class A membership upon the happening of either of the following events, whichever occurs earlier:

**\(a\)** when the total votes outstanding in the Class A membership equal the total votes \(tripled as stated above\) outstanding in the Class B membership; or

**\(b\)** on the second anniversary of the first conveyance of a subdivision interest in the Project.

During the time that there are two \(2\) outstanding classes of membership any action by the Association which must have the approval of the Members before being undertaken shall require the vote of a majority of a quorum of each class of membership, or written assent of a majority of each class of membership. Where the vote or written assent of each class of membership is required, any requirement that the vote of Declarant be excluded is not applicable, except as provided in the Declaration. After the conversion of Class B membership to Class A membership, any provision herein requiring the approval of Members other than Declarant, except as provided otherwise in the Declaration, shall mean the vote of a majority of a quorum, or written assent of a majority of the total voting power of the Association \(including Declarant's vote\(s\)\) and the vote of a majority of a quorum, or written assent of a majority of the total voting power of Members other than the Declarant.

### 3.7. Eligibility to Vote

Voting rights attributable to Units shall not vest until Assessments against those Units have been levied by the Association. Only Members in good standing shall be entitled to vote on any issue or matter presented to the Members for approval. In order to be in good standing, a Member must be current in the payment of all Assessments levied against the Member's Unit and not subject to any suspension of voting privileges as a result of any disciplinary proceeding conducted in accordance with the Declaration. A Member's good standing shall be determined as of the record date established in accordance with Section 3.8. The Association shall not be obligated to conduct a hearing in order to suspend a Member's voting privileges on the basis of the nonpayment of Assessments, although a delinquent Member shall be entitled to request such a hearing. A Member shall maintain good standing if said standing has not been suspended by the provisions of these Bylaws and the Member has maintained a current filing with the Association of the following: \(i\) the signature or signatures of the Owner\(s\) authorized to vote on behalf of the Member's Unit; and \(ii\) address where all notices shall be sent; or, alternatively \(iii\) a proxy that names the Owner's representative and lists said representative's address.

### 3.8. Record Dates

#### A. Record Dates Established by the Board

For the purpose of determining which Members are entitled to receive notice of any meeting, vote, act by written ballot without a meeting, or exercise any rights in respect to any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a "record date," and only Members of record on the date so fixed are entitled to receive notice, to vote, or to take action by written ballot or otherwise, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any membership on the books of the Association after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Articles, by agreement, or in the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law.

#### B. Failure of Board to Fix a Record Date

If the Board, for any reason, fails to establish a record date, the following rules shall apply:

3. **Record Date for Action by Written Ballot Without Meeting:** The record date for determining those Members entitled to vote by written ballot on proposed Association actions without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board has been taken, shall be the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited.

### 3.9. Action Without Meeting

Any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of Members \(except the election of Directors\) may be taken without a meeting in accordance with the provisions of California Corporations Code §§ 7513 and 7516. Any form of written ballot distributed by any person to the membership of the Association shall afford the opportunity to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of matters to be acted upon, except it shall not be mandatory that a candidate for election to the Board be named in the written ballot. The written ballot shall provide that, where the Member specifies a choice, the vote shall be cast in accordance with that choice.

### 3.10. Conduct of Meetings

Meetings of the membership of the Association shall be conducted in accordance with a recognized system of parliamentary procedure or such parliamentary procedures as the Association may adopt. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, notice of meetings of the Members shall specify those matters the Board intends to present for action by the Members, but, except as otherwise provided by law, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for action. Members of the Association shall have access to Association records in accordance with Article 3 \(commencing with Section 8330\) of Chapter 13 of Part 3 of Title 1 of the California Corporations Code. Any Member shall be permitted to speak at a meeting of the Association Members; however, the Board of Directors may establish a reasonable time limit for Members to speak before a meeting of the Association Members.

### 4.2. Number

The Association shall have not less than three \(3\) nor more than seven \(7\) Directors. The number of Directors may be changed by approval of the Board.

###  4.3. Term of Office

At the first meeting of the Association the Members shall elect three \(3\) Directors for a term of one \(1\) year, and at each annual meeting thereafter the Members shall elect the authorized number of Directors for a term of one \(1\) year.

Unless vacated sooner, each Director shall hold office until the Director's term expires and a successor is elected.

### 4.4. Removal; Vacancies

Unless the entire Board is removed from office by the vote of Association Members, an individual Director shall not be removed prior to the expiration of his term of office if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast and the entire number of Directors authorized at the time of the most recent election of Directors were then being elected. A Director who was elected solely by the votes of Members other than Declarant may be removed from office prior to the expiration of his term only by the votes of a majority of Members other than Declarant. In the event of death or resignation of a Director, the vacancy shall be filled by approval of the Board at a duly held meeting, or by the sole remaining Director.

The ballots received from other Members shall be counted first, and the person receiving the greatest number of votes from such Members shall be elected to the Board. The votes of Declarant shall then be added to the totals, and the persons receiving the highest number of votes \(other than the person already elected\) shall be elected to the remaining positions on the Board.

### 5.3. Rules and Procedures for Elections

Pursuant to Section 3.11, the Board shall adopt rules and procedures for the conduct of elections as provided in California Civil Code Section 1357.120\(a\)\(7\).

Notice to Members of an emergency meeting is not required.

### 6.4. Quorum

A majority of the Directors then in office \(but not less than two \(2\)\) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if \(a\) a quorum is present, and \(b\) either before or after the meeting, each of the Directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting, or an approval of the minutes. The waiver of notice or consent need not specify the purpose of the meeting. Notice of a meeting shall also be deemed given to any Director who attends the meeting without protesting before or at its commencement about the lack of adequate notice.

### 6.9. Notice of Adjourned Meeting

Notice of the time and place of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given, unless the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four \(24\) hours, in which case personal notice of the time and place shall be given before the time of the adjourned meeting to the Directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment, and shall be posted at a prominent place within the Common Area.

A quorum shall be required only if so stated in the governing documents of the association or other provisions of law. If a quorum is required by the governing documents, each ballot received by the inspector of elections shall be treated as a member present at a meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. An Association shall allow for cumulative voting using the secret ballot procedures provided in this section, if cumulative voting is provided for in the governing documents.

\(c\)

1. The association shall select an independent third party or parties as an inspector of election. The number of inspectors of election shall be one or three.
2. For the purposes of this section, an independent third party includes, but is not limited to, a volunteer poll worker with the county registrar of voters, a licensee of the California Board of Accountancy, or a notary public. An independent third party may be a member of the association, but may not be a member of the board of directors or a candidate for the board of directors or related to a member of the board of directors or a candidate for the board of directors. An independent third party may not be a person, business entity, or subdivision of a business entity who is currently employed or under contract to the association for any compensable services unless expressly authorized by rules of the association adopted pursuant to paragraph \(5\) of subdivision \(a\).

4. An inspector of election shall perform his or her duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of his or her ability, and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three inspectors of election, the decision or act of a majority shall be effective in all respects as the decision or act of all. Any report made by the inspector or inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the report.

\(d\)

1. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: \(A\) "Proxy" means a written authorization signed by a member or the authorized representative of the member that gives another member or members the power to vote on behalf of that member. \(B\) "Signed" means the placing of the member's name on the proxy \(whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, or otherwise\) by the member or authorized representative of the member.
2. Proxies shall not be construed or used in lieu of a ballot.

3. Any instruction given in a proxy issued for an election that directs the manner in which the proxyholder is to cast the vote shall be set forth on a separate page of the proxy that can be detached and given to the proxyholder to retain.

The association shall use as a model those procedures used by California counties for ensuring confidentiality of voter absentee ballots, including all of the following:

1. The ballot itself is not signed by the voter, but is inserted into an envelope that is sealed.  This envelope is inserted into a second envelope that is sealed. In the upper left hand corner of the second envelope, the voter shall sign his or her name, indicate his or her name, and indicate the address or separate interest identifier that entitles him or her to vote.
2. The second envelope is addressed to the inspector or inspectors of election, who will be tallying the votes. The envelope may be mailed or delivered by hand to a location specified by the inspector or inspectors of election. The member may request a receipt for delivery.

\(f\) All votes shall be counted and tabulated by the inspector or inspectors of election or his or her designee in public at a properly noticed open meeting of the board of directors or members. Any candidate or other member of the association may witness the counting and tabulation of the votes. No person, including a member of the association or an employee of the management company, shall open or otherwise review any ballot prior to the time and place at which the ballots are counted and tabulated. The inspector of election, or his or her designee, may verify the member's information and signature on the outer envelope prior to the meeting at which ballots are tabulated. Once a secret ballot is received by the inspector of elections, it shall be irrevocable.

\(g\) The tabulated results of the election shall be promptly reported to the board of directors of the association and shall be recorded in the minutes of the next meeting of the board of directors and shall be available for review by members of the association. Within 15 days of the election, the board shall publicize the tabulated results of the election in a communication directed to all members.

\(h\) The sealed ballots at all times shall be in the custody of the inspector or inspectors of election or at a location designated by the inspector or inspectors until after the tabulation of the vote, and until the time allowed by Section 7527 of the Corporations Code for challenging the election has expired, at which time custody shall be transferred to the association. If there is a recount or other challenge to the election process, the inspector or inspectors of election shall, upon written request, make the ballots available for inspection and review by an association member or his or her authorized representative. Any recount shall be conducted in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the vote.

\(i\) After the transfer of the ballots to the association, the ballots shall be stored by the association in a secure place for no less than one year after the date of the election.

\(j\) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the rules adopted pursuant to this section may provide for the nomination of candidates from the floor of membership meetings or nomination by any other manner. Those rules may permit write-in candidates for ballots.

\(k\) Except for the meeting to count the votes required in subdivision \(f\), an election may be conducted entirely by mail unless otherwise specified in the governing documents.

\(l\) The provisions of this section apply to both incorporated and unincorporated associations, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the governing documents.

\(m\) The procedures set forth in this section shall apply to votes cast directly by the membership, but do not apply to votes cast by delegates or other elected representatives.
