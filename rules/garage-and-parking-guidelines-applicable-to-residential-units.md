# Garage and Parking Guidelines Applicable to Residential Units

## **Vehicle Parking Spaces Only**

No parking space shall be used for any purpose other than the parking of Permitted Vehicles except by written authorization of the Board of Directors.  Bicycles that are registered in accordance with the Rules may be parked or stored in in bicycle racks or tracks installed. No parking is allowed within the Building which obstructs free traffic flow, constitutes a nuisance or otherwise creates a hazard. 

## **Permitted Vehicles**

Only Permitted Vehicles shall be parked, stored or operated within AXIS. Permitted vehicles shall mean appropriately licensed passenger automobiles, sports utility vehicles, motorcycles, and trucks having carrying capacity of ¾ ton or less, vans having seating capacity of eight \(8\) persons or less.  Residents and their guests shall park their Permitted Vehicles only in the parking space appurtenant to or assigned to their Unit. Vehicles that are not Permitted Vehicles shall not be parked or stored in AXIS. Except for commercial vehicles or construction equipment that are providing services to a Unit or the Association \(but only during the period of time in which such services are being provided and subject to the Rules\), Permitted Vehicles shall not include any commercial vehicle, construction equipment, trailer, camper, mobile home, recreational vehicle, truck having a carrying capacity of greater than ¾ ton, van having seating capacity in excess of eight \(8\) persons or any vehicle which is too large to fit within the Homeowner’s parking space, inoperable or abandoned vehicles, boats or similar equipment. Vehicles that are otherwise Permitted Vehicles that are used for both business and personal use are not prohibited, provided that any signs or markings of a commercial nature on such vehicles shall be unobtrusive and inoffensive as determined by the Board. No excessively noisy or smoky vehicles shall be operated on AXIS.  No Resident of any Unit shall park more Permitted Vehicles within the project at any one given time than the number of parking spaces assigned to the Unit.

## **Use / Towing**

The parking garage is intended for use by residents and those they authorize. Residents shall park only in their assigned parking space. All vehicles are required to display an AXIS parking tag while parked inside the garage. If a vehicle is parked in an assigned Resident or staff space in violation of the Governing Documents, the following will apply: 

* If the vehicle does not have a parking permit or is not registered in Building Link, the vehicle will be towed immediately at the resident’s expense.
* If the vehicle does have a parking tag or is registered, the resident assigned to that tag number will be attempted to be notified and given one hour to have the vehicle moved before it is towed at the homeowners’ expense.
* Any vehicle parked in the emergency lanes, in front of the entrance gates, or impeding traffic will be towed immediately at the resident’s expense. No parking is allowed anywhere within the parking garage except in the designated spaces. No parking space shall be converted to any use, such as a storage room, that would prevent its use as a parking space for the number of vehicles the space was designed to contain. Motorcycle parking spaces are available to Residents on a first come, first served basis.
* Violations for parking in an unauthorized area will not receive a warning. First incidence will incur a $150 fine.

The vehicle’s owner or agent shall be solely responsible for any and all towing fees resulting from the failure to adhere to these policies.  These rules are subject to change by the Board of Directors at any time in order to be in compliance with the Axis HOA governing documents. 

Homeowners are liable for any and all damage/violations or costs incurred by their Lessees and/or guests up to and including all fines. No vehicles leaking any substance are allowed in the parking garage. No vehicle shall be operated recklessly in any way, which creates undue danger or nuisance to other residents or guests.

## **Car Alarms**

Should a car alarm continue to go off, the General Manager or the Association may, at the Resident’s expense, have the vehicle towed from the garage.  Vehicle alarms that do not automatically go off after an interval are not allowed.

## **Car Permit Placement/Usage**

The AXIS parking permit \(square 3 x 3 orange permit\) should be placed in bottom right corner of the vehicle’s windshield \(from inside the car\). The permit must be displayed at all times. Failure to properly display the permit may result in a fine being issued by the board. Due to the cling nature of the permits, motorcycles will not have to display the permit; however, motorcyclists must present their fob upon request of any resident or staff.

Additional parking permits may be purchased for $25. Regardless of the number of permits owned by the unit, the unit will have access to only as many parking spots as assigned to the unit per the CC&R’s. If a resident leases a parking spot to another resident \(non-residents are not allowed to lease parking in AXIS\), they will also provide a parking permit with that lease.

## **Disabled Parking Space**

Certain Parking Spaces in the Parking Garage are handicapped spaces and are designated as such in the Condominium Plan. Declarant has assigned some or all of these spaces to Condominiums as Exclusive Use Common Area parking spaces. If the occupants of the Condominiums assigned a handicapped space are not appropriately licensed to use a handicapped parking space by the State of California and the occupant of another Condominium assigned a parking space is appropriately licensed and the space assigned this Condominium is not a handicapped parking space \(the “Licensed Occupant”\), the Association, on receipt of written request from the Licensed Occupant, shall require the Owner of a Condominium assigned a handicapped space to exchange the handicapped space with the space assigned to the Condominium occupied by the Licensed Occupant. The exchange shall remain in effect as long as the Licensed Occupant occupies the Condominium and remains licensed to use a handicapped space and shall terminate automatically on the date the Licensed Occupant ceases to occupy the Condominium or ceases to be appropriately licensed to use a handicapped parking space, whichever occurs first.  The exchange shall be temporary and shall not alert the permanent parking space\(s\) assigned to any Condominium and appurtenant to the Condominium.  The Owners of the Condominiums assigned the handicapped spaces covenant to cooperate with the Association and any Licensed Occupant in effecting any exchange required under this section. 

If the handicapped spaces are assigned to Condominiums where the occupants are not licensed to use a handicapped space and the spaces have not been exchanged with the space of a Licensed Occupant, the selection of the available handicapped space to be exchanged with the space of the Licensed Occupant shall be by agreement between the Owners of the Condominiums with the assigned handicapped spaces. If the Owners cannot reach agreement for any reason within ten \(10\) days after receipt of written request form the Licensed Occupant to effect the exchange, the selection shall be made by lottery by the President of the Association. The selection resulting from the lottery shall be final and binding. The right to exchange a non-handicapped space for a handicapped space shall be available to any Licensed Occupant on a first-come, first-served basis. The Board may adopt rules regulating the exchange of non-handicapped spaces for handicapped spaces that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section.

## **Driving the wrong way in the parking garage**

Violations for driving the wrong way in the garage or for parking in an unauthorized area will not receive a warning. First incidence will incur a $150 fine.

## **Fire Lanes**

There is no parking in the fire lanes located within the Parking Garage \(Areas in front of Elevators in B1, B2 & B3 are Fire Lanes\).  Any vehicle parked within a fire lane may be towed at the Resident’s expense without prior notice in accordance with all Applicable Laws.  

## **Guest Parking**

There is no guest parking.

## **Lease, Relocate and/or Exchange of an Assigned Parking Space**

Parking Spaces assigned for the exclusive use of the Owner of a designated Residential Unit may be licensed, but not exchanged, with other Homeowners.  Only Homeowners can license, or otherwise acquire rights to the exclusive use of a Parking Space.  The conveying Owner must notify the General Manager and the Association of the name of the Owner to whom the Parking Space has been licensed by submitting a License of Parking Space form found in the Forms section of this Rules and Policies Handbook to the General Manager. Any agreement shall be a license only and shall not transfer any other interest in the space. Each license must be on a month-to-month basis, terminated on no later than thirty \(30\) days prior notice by the condominium owner.

## **No Vehicle Maintenance**

No working on vehicles, other than emergency work, is permitted anywhere in the Parking Spaces or any other area in the Parking Garage.  This includes, without limitation, washing, changing oil, light maintenance, etc.  All vehicles, motorcycles, mopeds and bicycles within AXIS must be operable and possess a current license and registration.  If a vehicle becomes inoperable while parked at AXIS, the Owner of such vehicle must make arrangements to remove the inoperable vehicle as soon as reasonably possible.  

## **Noise**

No excessive noise from vehicles or revving up of engines is permitted.  Vehicles which are of sufficient volume when driven to set off car alarms in the garage may not be parked in the Parking Garage.

## **Oil Leaks**

Excessive oil leaks and stains caused by a user’s vehicle will be subject to fines and/or the cost of clean-up and repairs.  Please use and monitor the condition of oil catching and absorbing materials underneath your vehicle to prevent excessive staining.  Preventative maintenance of your vehicle will help to alleviate this issue.  

## **Opening Doors**

Please take care when opening your car doors so you do not dent or chip the paint off your neighbor’s car.

## **Parking Garage**

The Parking Garage is for use by Residents.  Each Residential Owner has been assigned a Parking Space in the Parking Garage.  The Association has no obligation to find alternative parking spaces for any Occupant while the Parking Garage is being cleaned, maintained or repaired.

## **Prohibited Vehicles**

See [Permitted Vehicles](garage-and-parking-guidelines-applicable-to-residential-units.md#permitted-vehicles) section.

## **Speed and Lights**

All drivers must maintain safe and proper speeds and observe a maximum speed of **5 miles per hour** while driving in the Parking Garage.  There may be blind spots present.  It is recommended that your headlights be turned on while driving in the Parking Garage. 

**Stopping a vehicle in any driveway is prohibited.**

## **Registration**

If required by the General Manager, each Resident must register with the General Manager, the automobile\(s\) that he or she wishes to have designated as an Authorized Vehicle that will be parked in the Parking Garage.  To register a vehicle, the Resident must provide to the General Manager the following: 

* A signed application for registration of the vehicle in the form provided by the General Manager;
* The vehicle's California license plate number;
* A description of the vehicle, including its make, model and color;
* A signed waiver and release in form approved by the Association; and
* Such other information as the General Manager may reasonably request.

Upon receiving the information set forth above, the General Manager shall issue to such Resident a garage fob to be allowed to park in the Parking Garage.  Upon sale or lease of a Condominium or the expiration of a lease of a Condominium, the Owner that is selling or leasing his or her Condominium or the former Lessee of a Condominium must turn over the devices to the new occupant. If a Resident fails to turn over the garage fob to new occupant, the successor Resident shall be required to pay the fee for a new garage fob for use by such Resident.  

## **Reporting Violations**

Residents may contact the General Manager or Property Management company to report parking rule violations. The reporting parties must identify themselves. The Property Management company will not be authorized to take parking enforcement action based on anonymous reports.  

## **Vehicle Size**

Your vehicle must fit completely within your Parking Space and not restrict your neighbor’s ability to park in his or her Parking Space.  Oversized vehicles such as limousines and extra-large vehicles, may not fit in your Parking Space and, therefore, it may be necessary to find parking outside the Community.
