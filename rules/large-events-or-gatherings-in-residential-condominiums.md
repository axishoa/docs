# Large Events or Gatherings in Residential Condominiums

All events and gatherings shall also be subject to the following:

The event or gathering must be confined to the hosting Resident’s Condominium. However, if needed, a hosting Resident may request permission from the General Manager to use portions of the Association Property; provided, however, such use will not unreasonably disturb \(as determined by the Association\) other Residents and shall be subject to the other restrictions set forth in this Rules and Policies Handbook. 

No guest may park in the Parking Garage. Any unauthorized vehicles parking in the Parking Garage are subject to enforcement action by the Association, including, without limitation, towing at the vehicle owner’s expense in accordance with Applicable Laws. 

Any damage to the Association Property or any other portion of the Community arising out of the event or gathering will be the responsibility of the Resident of the Residential Condominium where the event is being hosted.  The Association shall have the right to require a deposit for any large gathering or event.

All requests for abatement of noise or conduct from the General Manager, Association personnel or other Residents must be observed.  Failure to comply with such requests may result in early termination of the gathering at the discretion of the General Manager or other Association personnel, as appropriate.

Please remember the intent of these guidelines is to assure the enjoyment of all and to minimize damage to Association Property.
