# Barbecues

Barbecues have been installed in the amenity level for the use and enjoyment of all Residents and their guests.  

## **First Come First Served Basis**

The barbecues are available on a first-come, first-served basis for use by Residents and their guests.  

One grill, the dining table plus chairs, and one-half of the kitchen/bar area nearest the small spa may be reserved. Any event must not inhibit use of the facilities by other Residents. Reservations can be made for one time slot: 10am-2pm, 2pm – 6pm, or 6pm – 10pm.  Set-up and clean-up should occur during this four-hour period. You may NOT move to the other grill once reservation is over.

BBQ use is on a first come first serve basis unless a reservation is made with the concierge. See the BBQ reservation rules. Please be courteous and share the BBQ's. Residents are expected to clean BBQ's and food preparation areas immediately following use. 

## **BBQ Reservation Rules**

A maximum of 18 people, including Residents is allowed per event. The Resident’s contact information and guest names must be given to the Front Desk one week before the event or the reservation will be cancelled. Resident may only have one reservation at any given time. Resident is responsible for their guests and for their compliance with AXIS HOA Pool and BBQ rules. Any violations of rules are subject to the Association’s fine procedures.

## **Cleaning**

Please make sure the barbecues are turned off after each use and the area is clean of debris or personal items before leaving. 

## **Glass Containers**

No glass containers are permitted in the barbecue or pool areas. 

## **“No glass” in the pool area**

Warnings will no longer be given for glass in the pool area. The **first incidence** of glass in the pool area will incur a **$300 fine.** Additional incidents of glass in the pool area will result in a doubling of the previous fine.

## **Outside Vendors/Equipment**

All outside vendors and equipment desired to be used during an event must be approved by the AXIS HOA Board in advance.

## **Pets**

Pets \(except service animals\) are prohibited at the pool. 

Use of the Reserved BBQ requires that a form be filled out and submitted 7 days prior to planned event.  The form will have a few more details about use of BBQ and the area.
