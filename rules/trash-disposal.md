# Trash Disposal

## **Trash Rooms**

Trash rooms are located on every floor of the Building.  The trash rooms contain trash and recycle chutes for disposal of trash and recycling materials.  

## **Using the Trash Chute**

The following are general rules that must be followed when using the Trash Chute:

* Trash disposal hours are 9:00am to 10:00pm daily. For the consideration of your neighbors, please avoid dumping trash or recyclables down the chute after 10:00pm and before 9:00am. 
* All refuse deposited into the trash chutes must be securely bagged, sealed and able to freely travel to the 1st floor.  Open containers such as paper sacks, boxes, unsecured plastic bags, and/or reusable garbage cans are prohibited. 
* No volatile, flammable or hazardous materials or any similar items contrary to Applicable laws may be deposited into the Trash Chute or any other trash facility. 
* No Resident shall place any trash in any stairwells. 
* Please do not leave trash in the Trash Chute Rooms for someone else to pick up.
* Do not force the Trash Chute door shut.  The door shuts automatically after opening.  
* Keep all hands and fingers clear of the Trash Chute door to avoid injury.  
* Glass items to be thrown away or recycled may be placed in the Trash Chute if double bagged in a clear plastic bag and mixed with other trash. You may also bring to the first floor. There is a glass recycle trash bin on the first floor.
* DO NOT allow any body parts to extend beyond the opening of the Trash Chute.  
* All trash must be bagged securely in a sealed PLASTIC bag before being deposited into the Trash Chute.  
* No trash bags larger than seventeen \(17\) gallons may be deposited into the Trash Chute.
* Absolutely NO open containers containing liquids or other substances that can coat or stick to the interior of the Trash Chute are permitted without being first placed in a properly sealed plastic bag.
* No boxes may be deposited into the trash chute unless the box is small enough to fit in a normal size trash bag.  As a rule of thumb, any box that must be broken down to fit though the Trash Chute must not be put into the Trash Chute.  Any box larger than a shoebox must be placed in the bin on the 1st floor.
* No compacted trash bags may be deposited into the Trash Chute.  

Residents may contact the General Manager’s office to arrange for oversized trash items to be picked up.  A fee may be charged, in the discretion of the Board, for the removal of such trash, depending upon the type, amount and other considerations.

Any violation of rules are subject to the Association’s fine procedures.

## **Clean Up**

In the event of damage to bags in the disposal process, Residents are responsible for cleaning up trash spilled in the Building and disposing of it in the proper receptacles.  Residents will be assessed for any cleanup services provided by the Association.  

## **Oversized Items**

Oversized items such as cardboard boxes and other oversized items should not be left outside or in the trash rooms.  It is the Residents’ sole responsibility to remove these items from the Building and dispose of them in appropriate containers/bins on the 1st floor.

## **Construction Debris**

Contractors and other service providers shall not place any construction materials in the dumpsters.

## **Recycling**

Pursuant to the requirements of the City of San Jose, the Association shall adopt a recycling program for the Community and each Resident shall comply with the recycling program.  Recycling containers are located on the Ground Floor outside the garage lobby entrance.

## **Batteries**

No batteries of any type may be disposed of in the dumpsters.  Batteries must be disposed of properly in accordance with applicable laws.

## **Removal of Move-in/Move Out Debris**

Each Resident must remove or arrange with its moving company for the proper removal of all trash, debris, crates, boxes and other materials used in connection with a move or delivery as provided in the Move-In/Move-Out Procedures. 

## **Failure to Remove Debris**

If a Resident fails to remove the debris, any and all debris left by a Resident or his or her Invitees within the Association Property may be removed by General Manager and the applicable Resident must pay for all costs associated with such removal.  Such costs may be deducted from any deposit paid by the Resident.
