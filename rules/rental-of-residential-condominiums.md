## **Responsibility of Owner**

Each Lessee must comply with all the maintenance responsibilities of an Homeowner with respect to the use of the Unit and all Exclusive Use Easement Areas.  However, the Homeowner who is leasing his or her Unit is not relieved of the maintenance obligations when his or her Unit is leased.  The Association will hold such leasing Homeowner responsible for any failure or non-compliance of its Lessee\(s\) to diligently perform the maintenance obligations set forth in the Warranty and Maintenance Manual and any other obligations under any of the Governing Documents.  In the event any Lessee causes damage to the Community or violates the terms of the lease agreement, the Association will pursue available remedies against the applicable Homeowner and/or the Lessee.  However, even if the Association elects to pursue remedies against the Lessee, the Association still has the right to also pursue remedies against the applicable Homeowner whose Lessee or Invitees have violated the Association Governing Documents and the Homeowner remains primarily liable for the actions of its Lessees and Invitees.  

## **Timesharing**

## **Assessments**

A Lessee shall have no obligation to the Association to pay assessments imposed by the Association.  Each Homeowner remains liable for the payment of such assessments.

## **Insurance**

Homeowners are responsible for ensuring that their Lessee maintain the appropriate renter's insurance in sufficient amounts to cover the cost of replacement of all such Lessees' personal property and liability at AXIS during the entire term of their respective lease agreements.  The obligation of the Lessees of Homeowners to maintain renters' insurance in no way limits or replaces the insurance obligations of Homeowners under the Association Governing Documents.  Since each insurance carrier may vary in policy, it is each Homeowner’s responsibility to obtain the appropriate type of insurance for such Homeowner’s Unit while it is leased and that the form of such insurance, including all coverage amounts, complies with such Homeowner's obligations under the applicable Governing Documents.  Depending on the insurance carrier, an Homeowner may be required to change their property insurance coverage to a commercial or other type of business policy as dictated by such Homeowner's individual insurance carrier.  Neither the Association, nor the General Manager, may advise you on such matters.
