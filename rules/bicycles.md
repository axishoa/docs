# Bicycles

## **Bicycles on Association Property**

Bicycles must be carried when being transported through the AXIS, except in the garage, where they may be ridden to their designated parking/storage area. 

## **Bicycle Storage**

Limited spaces for bicycle storage will be made available to Residents on a “first come, first served” basis.  Owners must park bicycles in assigned bike spots. The Association has the right to establish additional rules and policies relating to these spaces, including, without limitation the requirement that each bicycle be registered with the General Manager and require the placement of an identifying sticker as proof such bicycle is authorized in such parking spaces.  Residents are responsible for their own locks on any bicycles stored in the bicycle storage area.  The Association and General Manager are not responsible for the security of any bicycles stored in the bicycle storage area.

## **Bicycle Storage Fee**

The cost to store each bicycle is $60 per year or $5 per month.  For Owners, payments will be set up for recurring charge of $5 and post monthly to the HOA Account.  Renters must pay $60 for the full year \(may be prorated at $5 per month if needed\).
