# Move-In/Move-Out and Delivery

## Prior to Your Move

To insure proper scheduling and availability of the move-in elevator designated for your move, please request a move-in/move-out reservation via Building Link or contact the General Manager at least seven \(7\) business days prior to your move-in/move-out to reserve a time\(s\) for your move-in/move-out. At that time you should review any questions that you might have regarding these move-in/move-out procedures. You must also submit a Move-In/Move-Out Agreement located in the Forms Sectionof this Rules and Policies Handbook prior to your move.

## Moving Fee, Deposit and Scheduling

Each Resident must schedule his or her move- in/move-out date. At the time you schedule your move, you must sign the Move-In/Move-Out Agreement stating that you understand that a **NON-REFUNDABLE $120 FEE \(prorated if less than 5 hours\) AND A $300 DEPOSIT \(which will be refunded to the extent there is no damage caused to the Building\)** must be delivered to the General Manager five \(5\) business days prior to the move. The moving fee is non-refundable and will cover the Association’s administrative costs related to your move. The deposit is applicable to all damage, repair, cleaning, losses or other liabilities and charges incurred as a result of the move. Additionally, you accept total responsibility for the cost of any damage, repair, cleaning, losses or other liabilities that may exceed the amount of the deposit. If you rent out your Unit and your Lessee moves out, you will be responsible for paying the $120 fee \(prorated if less than 5 hours\) and the $300 deposit for the move-out and another $120 fee \(prorated if less than 5 hours\) and another $300 deposit for the new Lessee moving in. If there is no damage, the deposit will be returned to you within thirty \(30\) days of the move as the Association will need to issue a new check.

The Association will have the ability to hire a security officer to be stationed at the Community entrance during the move if the Association determines this is necessary. The cost associated with the security officer for this specific purpose will be borne by the resident moving in or out.

## Times You May Move

Moves may be conducted between 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday, except for the following: New Year’s Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. An appointment to schedule a move-in or move-out of the building must be made seven \(7\) business days in advance of the move to insure access to the elevator within a specific timeframe and day. Please call the General Manager to schedule moves and deliveries. Unscheduled moves may result in a $500 fine being levied.

## Rules Violation

After a notice of a rule violation is issued and a hearing is held, a charge of five hundred dollars \($500\) may be levied if a mover, homeowner, or lessee attempts to begin a move-in/move-out without a prior reservation.

## Parking

If you are using a professional moving company, be sure to inform them that it will be necessary to park large moving trucks in the loading dock within the Community. As certain areas must be kept free of parked vehicles it is essential that the arrival time and size of moving vans be confirmed with the General Manager. If you have any questions or concerns about the size of the vehicle you intend to use, please discuss this matter with the General Manager PRIOR to the day of your move. If your moving truck will be parked on the public street it is your responsibility to obtain the necessary approvals or permits from the City of San Jose. The Association is not responsible for any parking violations by any Resident or their moving company. A designated path of travel within the Community for the moving company will be available from the General Manager.

## Your Moving Company

Please choose your moving company carefully. Each Homeowner and Lessee is fully responsible for any damage done to the Association Property during a move. Because of this liability, all moving companies obtained by a Homeowner or Lessee must carry their own insurance to cover such damage. A Homeowner or Lessee must deliver a current certificate of liability and workers’ compensation insurance, naming the Association as an additional insured, to the General Manager at least two \(2\) days before your scheduled move. No moving company will be permitted entry into the Community without first providing such certificate of insurance. If you plan to move from out-of-state, please either use a destination \(local\) agent for the company or instruct the driver to call the General Manager a minimum of seven \(7\) business days in advance to coordinate the time of arrival and to insure availability of the designated elevator.

Homeowners who wish to move in without using a professional moving company may do so providing they meet all the requirements of the moving companies, i.e., scheduling the elevator seven \(7\) business days in advance of the move and accompanying the Association’s representative on a walk-through before and after the move.

An elevator can be reserved for you or your movers for up to a six \(6\) hour block of time between 8:00am to 5:00pm. If no other reservation, time blocks prior to or after may be used. In order to allow the elevator to be held to one floor, the mover must register with the General Manager which will allow the elevator to be placed in service mode. The movers will also be provided with a keycard for the building. The keycard must be returned upon completion of themove. Failure to return such keys may entitle the Association to retain the Homeowner’s deposit. The loading dock hours are 8:00am to 8:00pm, every day.

* The moving company must provide protective covering for the elevator cab walls during the moving process. It is the mover’s responsibility to insure that these are in place prior to beginning the move. In the absence of protective coverings, all items must be wrapped in moving blankets. ONLY THE DESIGNATED ELEVATOR MAY BE USED FOR MOVE-INS/MOVE-OUTS.
* No moves will be permitted if the protective coverings are not fully in place.
* The homeowner is responsible for all costs for repairs necessitated by the move.
* The elevator dimensions are approximately: 65 inches X 81 inches X 105 inches
* Front door dimension are approximately: 3’ 6” X 7’

Please provide the moving company with a copy of the Memo to Moving Company Personnel, a copy of which is attached, so that they have a clear understanding of the moving requirements.

Although the Association has no obligation to pursue any costs for damage caused by a Homeowner’s or Lessee’s delivery/move from any party other than the applicable Homeowners, the Homeowners may be able to make a claim against the delivery/moving company who caused the damage in the amount charged to such Homeowners by the Association. Thus, it is important each Homeowner confirms that the delivery/moving company used or any individual involved in the move is properly insured to cover such costs. All Homeowners are advised that they should ensure their Lessees comply with this provision since the Association will charge the applicable Homeowner of all such costs since a Lessee is not a member of the Association and all Homeowners are responsible for the actions of their Lessees. Each Homeowner acknowledges and accepts the Association has no obligation to assist any Homeowner in making such a claim and claims made against a delivery/moving company or any other individual involved in a delivery/move is at each Homeowner’s discretion.

## After Your Move

At the end of the move, the Association Property must be cleared of all debris. All trash and debris must be carried off-site on a daily basis by you or your moving company. Please contact the General Manager for further details. Any Homeowner who disregards this regulation by leaving packing materials and boxes in the Association Property will be required to cover the cost of having a contractor remove this nuisance and fire hazard.
