# Rules Enforcement

The Association has the responsibility and right to enforce compliance with the Association Rules and Architectural Guidelines set forth in this Rules and Policies Handbook and the terms of any other Governing Document. Depending upon the severity and frequency of the violation and the violator, the choice of enforcement procedure\(s\) and/or the enforcement remedy utilized may vary.

All Homeowners will be liable to the Association for violations of the Association Rules and/or the terms of the Governing Documents and for any damage to the Association Property by them, or their respective Lessees and Invitees. Homeowners must take all necessary actions to ensure such Persons comply with the rules and regulations set forth in the Association Rules with respect to the use of any of portion of the Association Property.

If any Resident causes damages or fails to comply with the Governing Documents, the Association shall have no obligation to pursue other available remedies against such Person\(s\) before seeking reimbursement from the applicable Homeowner for the costs of repairing the damage. The Homeowner remains primarily liable for the actions of its Lessees, Invitees and Service Providers. The Enforcement Procedures set forth below will apply to any violations of the Governing Documents including the Association Rules and Architectural Guidelines.

Any Homeowner may report violations to the Association by submitting a written notice to the General Manager describing the violation in detail. Similar notices will not be accepted from a Lessee. Except for emergency situations, any Lessee who wishes to report a violation must coordinate such violation notice\(s\) through the Homeowner of its leased Condominium.

Once the Association receives a written violation, the enforcement process may be started against the alleged violating Resident, as set forth below. However, nothing in this Section shall oblige or require the Board, or any authorized committee to take any such action. Homeowners are responsible for the conduct of their Lessees, Invitees, and Service Providers \(as defined below\).

## Other Remedies

The Association may take any other actions or a combination of actions, as permitted under the Governing Documents and/or Applicable Laws.
