# Fine Schedule

If the Board of Directors concludes that a violation of the Association Governing Documents has occurred, the Association may impose fines. The fine schedule for violations will be established by the Association and is subject to change from time to time. A copy of the fine schedule will be distributed to each Homeowner at the address listed in the Association’s records. The Association may enforce the collection of any fines or other charges through Assessments or any legal action that is available to the Association as permitted under the Association Governing Documents and/or Applicable Laws, and as deemed appropriate by the Association. Payment of an Assessment or fine or expiration of a suspension period does not eliminate the Resident’s obligation to correct the violation.

Reasonable fines will be levied in accordance with the following schedule and at the discretion of the Board based on the nature, frequency of Recurrence, duration and/or severity of the alleged offense:

Offenses older than 12 months will not be considered when determining the fine for a new offense.

* First Offense: $150
* Second Recurring Offense: $300
* Third Recurring Offense: $600
* Fourth Recurring Offense: $1,200
* Subsequent offenses continue doubling, up to a maximum of $19,200

Any fines are in addition to any other amounts payable to the Association for costs of repairing damage or reimbursing the Association for other expenses which the Association may incur under the Governing Documents.

## No Warning Fines

### Smoking Violation

Warnings will no longer be given for smoking. The first incidence of smoking in an area other than the designated smoking area will incur a $300 fine if found in violation at a hearing. Additional incidents of smoking will result in a doubling of the previous fine.

### Driving Wrong Way & Parking Violations

Driving the wrong way in the garage or parking in an unauthorized area will not receive a warning. First incidence will incur a $150 fine if found in violation at a hearing.

### “No glass” in the pool area

Warnings will no longer be given for glass in the pool area. The first incidence of glass in the pool area will incur a $300 fine if found in violation at a hearing. Additional incidents of glass in the pool area will result in a doubling of the previous fine.

## Other Fines

### Covered Smoke Detectors

If spray paint, sanding, or any other work that could potentially set off the smoke detectors or fire sprinklers will be performed, it is permissible to cover smoke detectors and/or fire sprinklers with plastic \(and no other material\), but the plastic must be removed at the end of each day. If determined that you did not remove the plastic cover, you will be given a Notice of Violation and a Hearing will be scheduled. If found in violation, a fine of $500 will be charged for each smoke detector or fire sprinkler left covered overnight.

### Unauthorized Move

If a mover, homeowner, or lessee attempts to begin a move-in/move-out without a prior reservation and such move will not be permitted to proceed. After notice of a rules violation is issued and a hearing is held, a charge of five hundred dollars \($500\) may be levied if found in violation.
