For any patio, balcony or roof deck furnishings and window coverings, the Homeowner shall submit one \(1\) copy of a picture showing the furnishings and/or samples of proposed fabrics and finishes.

Homeowners installing or altering hard surface flooring must submit the following \(in addition to meeting the above listed requirements\) for any hard-surface flooring to the Architectural Committee:

### Wall, Ceiling and Curtain Attachments

A Homeowner desiring to attach televisions or other fixtures to the walls or install curtains, chandeliers or pictures which penetrate through the drywall and require extra supports must obtain approval of the Association prior to the installation of such items detailing the location and the mounting techniques. No Application Fee is required unless the Association determines the installation does require further review and approval, in which case the Homeowner may be required to submit an application fee and other documents required by the General Manager. Regardless of whether approvals are required and/or obtained, Homeowners remain liable for any damage to persons or property caused by any penetration of the drywall.

## Review Fees

### Deposit

In addition to the Application Processing Fee, the Homeowner must pay a deposit in an amount determined by the Architectural Committee to cover any damage to Association Property during the course of construction of any Improvements. Each Homeowner is solely liable for all damage caused by an Homeowner or any Service Provider of an Homeowner, including, but not limited to, all fines and surcharges levied against the Homeowner by the Architectural Committee. The Homeowner’s liability shall not be limited by the amount of the deposit. If such costs of repairs, fines or surcharges are not promptly paid by the Homeowner, then all work must cease until the deposit has been replenished to an amount determined by the Architectural Committee \(not to exceed the maximum amount that has been set for deposits\).

### Outside Consultant Fee

The Board may also require an Homeowner to pay any fees, costs or expenses associated with the review and approval of the Homeowner’s Plans and Specifications by an Outside Consultant or any costsassociated with the review of the Plans and Specifications by an architect on the Architectural Committee, if any. Any structural improvements may be require approval by a licensed architect, sound engineer and any other person reasonably required to evaluate the design.

### Additional Fees

Additional fees may be imposed on Homeowners if determined necessary, based upon the complexity or scope of the Submittal Package and/or to retain consultants. If such fees are determined necessary, you will be notified by the General Manager and you will be required to submit the additional fee\(s\) within ten \(10\) days of the request.

## Review of Application

The General Manager shall, upon behalf of the Architectural Committee, review the Submittal Package to ensure that it contains all of the information and fees required.

If the Submittal Package is complete, the General Manager will forward the Submittal Package to the Architectural Committee. The General Manager may determine and notify the Homeowner that, based upon the proposed Improvements or the complexity of the proposed Improvements, additional review fees will be required. The Submittal Package will not be submitted to the Architectural Committee unless the Submittal Package is completed and until such fees are paid. Failure to submit a complete Submittal Package and include the appropriate fees with the Submittal Package will constitute an incomplete application, and the application will be returned to the Homeowner for completion prior to review by the Architectural Committee. The Submittal Package may be deemed complete by the Homeowner unless the Homeowner is informed otherwise by the General Manager, within thirty \(30\) days after delivery to the General Manager.

The Architectural Committee will review the Submittal Package and will provide written notification of approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the proposed modifications to the General Manager. The General Manager will then provide written notice of the actions taken by the Architectural Committee within thirty \(30\) days from the receipt of the Submittal Package along with one \(1\) set of the Submittal Package, appropriately marked with the Architectural Committee’s action. If an Homeowner fails to receive notice of the action by the Architectural Committee within the thirty \(30\) day period, then the Homeowner shall have the right to deliver a reminder notice to the Architectural Committee and General Manager.

If an Homeowner’s proposal is not approved, or returned as incomplete, a revised Submittal Package may be submitted. Provided the re-submittal is prompt, and does not constitute a substantially revised proposal, the Architectural Committee will attempt to review the re-submitted application within thirty \(30\) day period. If the re-submittal is not prompt or includes substantially revised Plans and Specifications, an additional thirty \(30\) days may be required to complete the Architectural Committee’s review.

## Diligence in Construction

Upon final approval of the Submittal Package, the Homeowner shall promptly commence construction and diligently pursue completion of the construction in conformance with the construction schedule. An Homeowner must notify the Architectural Committee within seven \(7\) business days of becoming aware of any delays in the start or completion dates provided in its Submittal Package by delivering written notice to the General Manager. However, if any date\(s\) originally approved by the Architectural Committee are delayed by more than one hundred eighty \(180\) days, such Homeowner may be required to submit a new Submittal Package reflecting its revised date projections. If a new Submittal Package is required by the Architectural Committee, such Homeowner may be responsible for fees and deposits in connection with such new Submittal Package.
