# Compliance with Required Procedures

If an architectural change is made without the approval by the Architectural Committee or any violation of the Architectural Guidelines occurs, the Architectural Committee may deliver written notice of violation to the Homeowner. The violation notice shall specify a time period for removal of the non-conforming Improvement which the Architectural Committee reasonably determines is necessary to remove the non-conforming Improvement. The Homeowner shall, upon receipt of the violation notice remove the non-conforming Improvement within the time period specified in the Violation notice or make an appeal to the Board in writing. If an Homeowner fails to file an appeal within fifteen \(15\) days of the receipt of the notice of violation, the Homeowner shall have waived any right to appeal.

Within thirty \(30\) days of a request for a hearing, the Board shall schedule an appeal at a time and date to be determined by the Board. The appeal hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner and the Homeowner shall have the opportunity to present any information or evidence to have the fine excused or mitigated. The decision of the Board shall be final.
