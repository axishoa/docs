# General Guidelines and Requirements Relating to Work

Approval by the Architectural Committee does not constitute waiver of the requirements of any Governmental Agencies. Architectural approval of plans does not constitute acceptance of any technical or engineering specifications, and the Association assumes no responsibility for such. The function of the Architectural Committee is to review submittals for architectural design of Improvements, placement of Improvements, color schemes, exterior finishes and materials and similar features which are recommended for use in the Community. All technical and engineering matters are the responsibility of the Homeowner. In addition to the restrictions set forth in the Declaration and the Rules and Policies Handbook, each Homeowner shall also comply with the following restrictions and guidelines.

## Building Permits

The Association shall have the right to require an Homeowner to provide building permits for certain Improvements or changes. The applicant shall obtain Architectural Committee approval of any Improvements requiring a building permit prior to requesting such permit from the City. Any required building permits must be obtained by the Homeowner, at such Homeowner’s expense. The Association assumes no responsibility for failure to obtain building permits. Obtaining such permits does not waive the Homeowner’s obligation to obtain Architectural Committee approval.

## Damage to Association Property

An Homeowner shall be responsible for any damage to the Association Property caused by construction or of improvements by the Homeowner. All applicable charges for restoration will be charged back to the Homeowner by the Association and are due and payable per compliance with Article IV, Section 4.10 of the CC&R.
