# Sound and Vibration Attenuation

In any multi-family dwelling, sound may be audible and vibrations may be felt between units, particularly where the sound level of the source is sufficiently high and the background noise in an adjacent Unit is very low. Each Homeowner shall endeavor to minimize any noise transmission from his or her Unit.

## Penetrations

No holes or other penetrations shall be made in demising walls \(party walls\) without the prior approval of the Architectural Committee. No penetrations of any sort shall be made in the ceiling of any Unit. Acoustical sealant shall be packed around all holes made by nails or screws when hanging items from the wall.

## Minor Impact Insulation

No modifications shall be made to any Unit which would result in a reduction in the minimum impact insulation class of the Unit.

## Speakers

Speakers for music reproduction, television and other audio-visual devices shall not be supported from or contact demising walls and shall be elevated from the floor by a proper acoustic platform. Loudspeakers for music reproduction, television and other audio visual devices may be supported from or recessed into ceilings provided that: \(a\) the back of the speaker recessed into a ceiling is sealed to substantially reduce sound transmission through the concrete deck separating the Unit above; \(b\) such installation does not compromise the approved sound rating design of the ceiling systems between Units; and \(c\) such installation has been approved by the Association.

## Pianos

Pianos shall have at least 1‚ÅÑ2 inch neoprene pads under the supports to minimize vibration transmission into the structure.

## Rubber Castors

All furniture installed on hard surface flooring shall contain rubber castors or felt pads to minimize noise and vibration.

## No Attachment

No fixture or equipment that may cause vibrations, noise or other type of unreasonable annoyance or damage to Homeowners may be attached to the walls or ceilings of any Condominium. Devices such as ceiling- mounted music devices, televisions or surround sound systems, including, but not limited to, wall mounted speakers, flat screen televisions and other audiovisual devices, must be supported by proper wall mounts or floor stands or a proper acoustic platform that prevent such devices from coming in contact with a demising wall or floor surface. All such wall mounts must be installed in conformance with the Architectural Guidelines.
