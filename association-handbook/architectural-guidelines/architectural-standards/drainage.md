# Drainage

There shall be no interference with the established drainage patterns, level, or grade over any Unit or Association Property unless an adequate alternative provision is made for proper drainage and written approval is obtained from the Architectural Committee. The installation of any tile or other flooring material on roof decks, entry areas or patios is strictly forbidden as it will interfere with proper drainage.
