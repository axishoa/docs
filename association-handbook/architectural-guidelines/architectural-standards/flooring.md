# Flooring

## Submittal Requirements

Except for those floors installed by Declarant, no Homeowner shall install flooring \(including without limitation tile or hardwood floors\) or replace any flooring unless the prior approval of the Architectural Committee has been obtained.

Any installation of hardwood or hard surface flooring must be approved by the Architectural Committee and must include a sound control underlayment system with an Impact Insulation Class rating of 60 or better for a hardwood floor installation and 58 or better for carpet installation. Tile is only permitted in the bathrooms.

Installation of such sound control underlayment system shall include provisions for a perimeter insulation material which will ensure that impact noises are not transmitted into the Units below the floor either directly through the floor or by going around the floor and through the surrounding walls.

## Guidelines

Standard Terms and Conditions and impact insulation class will be approximately 58 for carpet and pad.

Standard Terms and Conditions and impact insulation class will be a minimum of 60 for wood or tile. Tile is only permitted in the bathrooms.

All floor areas within a Unit shall be covered with materials designed to minimize noise transmission. The installation of carpet must also include the installation of padding if the Unit is situated on any floor above any other Units or Association Property.

**Failure to ensure that flooring material and installation procedures adhere to these requirements may require removal at the Homeownerâ€™s expense.**
