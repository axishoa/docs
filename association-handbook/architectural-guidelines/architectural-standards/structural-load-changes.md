# Structural Load Changes

The Building is designed to support a forty \(40\) pound per square foot live load as outlined in the Uniform Building Code, Table 16A, Item 12. Any modifications to a Unit that might increase such load of a Unitâ€™s floor must be approved by a structural engineer and the Architectural Committee. These items include, without limitation, changes in flooring \(e.g., installation of ceramic tile, marble, granite\) and the placement of pool tables, pianos, potted plants or trees, and aquariums.
