# Wall Attachments

Homeowners are required to obtain approval to attach televisions or other fixtures to the walls or install curtains or chandeliers which penetrate through the drywall and require extra supports prior to the installation of such items detailing the location and the mounting techniques. The Association may impose conditions on such installations. Each Homeowner acknowledges that it remains liable to the Association and other Homeowners as a result of any damage caused to the Association Property resulting from any penetrations by such Homeowner or such Homeownerâ€™s Lessees.
