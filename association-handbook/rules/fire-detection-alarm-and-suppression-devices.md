# Fire Detection, Alarm and Suppression Devices

## **Fire Alarm System**

Residents and their guests are prohibited from tampering with the fire alarm system which includes:  smoke detectors, heat detectors, flow switches, and tamper switches, etc.  Disconnecting the horn in any Unit from the fire alarm system is against the law and will affect the operation of the horns in the other Units in the Community.  If you notice anything irregular about the fire alarm system in the Building, you should notify the General Manager immediately. 

## **Fire Detection, Alarm and Suppression Devices**

If any fire life safety device must be covered in connection with any improvement undertaken by a Homeowner, prior written approval must be obtained from the Association.  The Homeowner making such a request must comply with any requirements imposed by the General Manager.  Any disabling or removing of any Fire Life Safety System shall be performed by the Association or its agents, contractors or employees at the cost of the Homeowner requesting that the fire system be disabled.  Any covering plastic must be removed by 5:00 p.m. each day.  A fine may be charged for each smoke detector or fire sprinkler left covered overnight.  

## **Fire Extinguishers**

Fire extinguishers have been installed in certain portions of the Building in case of a fire.  No Resident, or their guests, may remove, borrow or tamper with any fire extinguisher except in case of a fire.  

## **Fire Sprinklers**

Each Resident must take care not to harm, damage or unnecessarily activate the fire sprinklers installed in his or her Unit.  The fire sprinklers are heat activated and permitting high heat, steam or burning in the vicinity of a fire sprinkler may cause it to activate, potentially causing extensive damage to your Unit, your personal property, the Association Property, and the residences adjacent to and below yours.  Except for periodic dusting, you should never touch or allow anything else to touch the fire sprinklers.  In particular, you are not allowed to have any item hanging from the fire sprinklers, including, without limitation plants, laundry, posters or other objects.  You should also not tie string, floss, wire or any other material on, around or across any portion of a fire sprinkler.  Nothing should be stored within eighteen inches \(18”\) of a sprinkler head.  ****

### **Accidental Set-Offs**

If a Resident accidentally sets off the fire sprinklers or suspects that the sprinkler in his or her Unit may be damaged or not functioning correctly, the Resident shall notify the Front Desk immediately.  Each Homeowner shall be responsible for any and all costs, expenses, liabilities, penalties and fines incurred by the Association or any other Resident or Homeowner if the fire sprinklers are set off as a part of the actions of a Resident or such Homeowner’s Occupants.  

## **Reimbursement Obligation for Citations or Fines by Fire Marshall**

If the Association is cited and fined by the Fire Marshall for any violation of local fire codes due to the actions of any particular Resident, the applicable Homeowner will be responsible for the full amount of the fine and will reimburse the Association within  thirty \(30\) days after receipt of a statement therefor from the Association.  If any fine is incurred as a result of the action of a Resident, the Association will seek reimbursement from the applicable Homeowner, and it will be the Homeowner’s responsibility to seek reimbursement from its Lessee or Permitted User accordingly.  The Homeowner is entitled to attend a hearing if they wish to contest. 

## **Smoke Detectors**

Each Homeowner must maintain the smoke detectors, alarms and horns installed in his or her Unit.  As part of this maintenance, Residents must replace all smoke detector batteries every twelve \(12\) months.
