# Offensive Conduct and Nuisances

## **Audio Volumes**

The volume of radio, stereo sets, television and musical instruments shall be held at a reasonable level in units and common areas at all times so other residents are not disturbed.  

## **Hazardous Materials**

No Hazardous Materials shall be stored, placed or used anywhere within the Association Property or a Condominium in violation of Applicable Laws.  Any Resident who receives written notice from the Association indicating an item in their possession violates this restriction must take all necessary actions to remove such item within twenty-four \(24\) hours of receiving such notice.  In the event the item is not removed within twenty-four \(24\) hours, the Association or authorized Association personnel may remove or cause the item\(s\) to be removed and charge the applicable Resident for any costs associated with such removal.

## **No Dumping**

No person shall discharge into the Buildingâ€™s sewer system, storm drain any toxic or noxious matter in such concentrations as to be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, welfare or violate any law.  Failure to adhere to this restriction may subject the violating Resident to liability under state and federal law for any clean up, personal injury or damage caused to another Condominium or any portion of the Community.

## **Odorous Matters**

No odorous matters shall be emitted upon or about the Building in such quantity as to be readily detectable outside the physical boundaries of the space within which such odor was generated.  Front doors to the Residential Units shall remain closed except for when accessing a Residential Unit. 

## **Speakers**

Speakers and floor supported musical instruments \(i.e. pianos and organs\) must be properly isolated \(as provided in the Architectural Guidelines\) from direct contact to floors and walls in order to minimize vibrations.  See section 4.4 for additional details.
